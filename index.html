          <h2>A Quick Introduction</h2>
          <p>My name is Benjamin Schlemmer, and I was born in Decatur, Indiana and raised in Ohio City, Ohio.
            I am a senior in college attending Ashland University with a major in Computer Science and a minor
            in Cyber Security. For fun, I like to work on video game design and development, and after graduation,
            I would like to go into video game design and development or software development.
